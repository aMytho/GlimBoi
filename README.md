A chatbot for Glimesh.tv

## Installation
Download the bot from the [releases](https://github.com/aMytho/GlimBoi/releases) page.
Run the installer for your platform. Windows users can use the .exe file. Linux users can use the .deb file. Other platforms can build the app manually or use wine.

> Note that only Windows users can recieve automatic updates.

Windows may display a warning. This is due to the lack of official licensing. Select run anyway.

## Authorization

GlimBoi requires authentication to talk as a bot/streamer account. Press authorize on the bot homepage. It will ask you to log in with a glimesh account. The account that authorizes the bot will be the one that the bot uses to speak. If you want the bot to talk as the streamer account log in with that account. If you want a custom bot name you need a Glimesh account with that name.

Once logged in you can go back to the bot. You can head to the chat page and start using Glimboi!

When you authorized the bot you got an access token. This token lasts for 1 hour. When it expires the bot should automatically refresh it. If you cannot get something to work you likely need to press the refresh token button or authorize again on the homepage.

Congratulations - You have completed the auth process! You can now use GlimBoi to its full potential.

## Updates
Windows can recieve automatic updates. Other platforms must manually update. You can download any version of the bot from the releases page. If the platform you want is not supported you can manually build the bot from the source code. Your platform must support Electron.
